# Battleship Game (JavaScript)

Single player Battleship game based on the original rules. The ships are placed randomly, and they do not touch along their edges and at their apices.
The player may choose the difficulty i.e. the number of torpedos available.
The game was created in collaboration with zumi000 (https://github.com/zumi000).

Instructions:

1. Select the desired number of torpedos.

2. Give the coordinates of your shot (the game only accepts capital letters and numbers).

3. Enjoy!
